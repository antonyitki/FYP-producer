# FYP-BSc-
This is my Final Year Project (BSc Computer Science), worth 40 credits and lenght 1 academic year. It is main field is AI and ML/DL. It is a science project to develop art and improve creativity to help humans and artistic people because the artefact is about generating music with ML and DL techniques. Research and familiarization with waves, DSP (Digital Signal Processor), communication and networking, energy and other physics and mathematical concepts, theories and ideas is ine of the objectives this project exists.

RNN-LSTM is the Machine Learning (ML) model that is used. There are 4 different models based on number of hiden layers and the quantity and quality for the training. Input data:
* erk (deutsch monophonic songs, 1700 .krn files)
* china (four different styles of monophonic songs, 2005 .krn files)
* <del>piano sonatas (all avaiable files because no much data avaiable, but songs are very complex and advanced level)</del>

To solve the problem when creating DL network and using input data more complex than simple monofonic songs, I trained DL erk and china datasets with RNN-GRU architecture. This newer neural network is more simple than LSTM.

One single layer is used in erk and china songs. DL (two or more hidden layers in the training of the model) is used again in china to compare results. Training take about 2 days because CPU used in a student laptop. With Colab, training is about one hour using free GPU service.
Mathematical evaluation of my model is NOT possible and a survey is performed. 10 songs will be listened for the answer if like or dislike the song.
Finally, sound analysis will be made in python using .wav files. I am using an online tool to convert initial outpou (MIDI) to .wav file. Others formats will be shown as output from my artefact generating music, but will not be analysed or studied.

Different files is used in this project in conjunction with different and varied software for different purposes. Python is the programming language in this project because the project requires small scripts/programs to be executed and joined. C and C++ was used when building a program to process initial data, but I found enought online data and unavaiable headers with no time to develop them, make this project 100% Phyton.


##### Future:
* Communication and networking
* Data science
* both will be ideal with predominance of networking (routers, switches, cables, antenas, radio, waves, telecommunication, energy, DSP, etc)
