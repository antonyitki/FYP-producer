# FYP-BSc-
This is my Final Year Project (BSc Computer Science), worth 40 credits and lenght 1 academic year. It is main field is AI and ML/DL. It is a science project to develop art and improve creativity to help humans and artistic people because my artefact is about generating music with ML and DL techniques.

RNN-LSTM is the Machine Learning (ML) model that is used. There are 4 different models based on number of hiden layers and the quantity and quality for the training. Input data:
* erk (deutsch monophonic songs, 1700 .krn files)
* china (four different styles ofmonophonic songs, 1200 .krn files)
* piano sonatas (all avaiable files because no much data avaiable, but songs are very complex and advanced level)

One single layer is used in erk and china songs. DL (two or more hidden layers in the training of the model) is used again in china to compare results, and in piano soonatas. Training take about 2 days because CPU used in a student laptop. With Colab, training is about one hour using free GPU service.
Mathematical evaluation of my model is NOT possible and a survey is performed. 10 songs will be listened for the answer if like or dislike the song.
Finally, sound analysis will be made in python using .wav files. I am using an online tool to convert initial outpou (MIDI) to .wav file. Others formats will be shown as output from my artefact generating music.
